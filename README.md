# Conns Box of Fun
Just some little snippets that i work on. Not made to be particularly easy to use, but hey, at least these ones don't need to be in C:/ like my old ones.
## FOR THE HELPER BOT
Relatively easy to use considering I made it at 5:08 am (as per standard procedure) and I can't even read what I'm typing. I'm mostly just playing around with fancy display deals with no real sense of direction or purpose. helperFace.bat is your looping display that i put on an extra monitor. helper.bat is your user input. The current working commands are timeTitle, dateTitle, infoTitle, test, time, and cls. The title commands make an updating whatever in the title of the command prompt screen, test shows what I'll eventually make into random time based events, time is obvious, and cls resets your variables and screen.
### KNOWN ISSUES
Lets see... the time is delayed for about half a second on a bad laptop, you can't do the same command two times in a row due to the way i handle command updates, the ping delays are often glitchy, test cuts itself off.
